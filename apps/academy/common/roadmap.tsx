          Our vault implementation, and the base of each of our products &
          frameworks that have been introduced and put into production.
          Everything is built on top of BentoBox and as more functionality is
          introduced they will be able to take advantage of Bento’s capabilities
          that include strategies for putting idle assets to use while earning
          extra yield for users, and internalizing actions such swaps within
          Bento that provide major gas-saving incentives.
        </p>
        <p>
          Strategies at the base are an important part of allowing users to earn
          more on their assets as they put them to work within our protocol,
          further development and focus will be on this side of Bento with more
          capable strategies and offering additional yield for many more tokens.
        </p>
        <p>
          Trident & Kashi have been built on BentoBox, thus they take advantage
          of these improvements that come with using Bento as our central vault
          to put idle assets to work within our products.
        </p>
        <p>
          For BentoBox to reach its full potential, much is in the works to
          support increased product development on top of Bento from within the
          team and outside collaborators. Majority of our developer outreach
          will be focused on supporting and promoting BentoBox to developers
          within our space. With included talks, hackathons, and much more
          planned we believe BentoBox has the potential to be a main
          infrastructure layer for DeFi akin to AWS and the web.

        <p>
          Initial release of Trident came at the end of March 2022, and it’s a
          central part of our vision going forward. Trident was designed as a
          framework, and is built using a single interface called the IPool
          interface. This allows us to continue rapid development of unique and
          new pool types, which can be slotted into the base framework much
          easier than in the past or compared to other AMM protocols.
        </p>
        <p>
          Constant product or the well-known 50-50 split of assets is now in
          production, and has been going through the battle testing phase on
          Polygon. We will continue to monitor it during this phase, while the
          release of three new pool types are in the pipeline and will be
          released alongside constant product pools in the near future. The
          three new pool types will be in the form of a Stable or like-kind
          asset pool, a concentrated liquidity style pool, and the third being a
          multi-asset index style pool.
        </p>
        <p>
          As Trident is a product framework, we expect and look forward to
          seeing many more iterations & types of pools to come into play over
          time. Our routing engine Tines has been designed to keep in mind the
          flexibility of our framework, and to simplify the process of
          introducing new pool types that have direct support for swaps as soon
          as they are pushed into production.
        </p>
        <p>
          Plans are in place to further upgrade Tines, and improve on the
          initial design that is in production now. We will continue to work
          towards a routing engine that works efficiently within our framework,
          and provides the best price for all swaps on our protocol.

        <p>
          Our isolated lending protocol was introduced almost a year ago, and
          has been sufficiently battle-tested so far. Due to this, we will be
          continuing further work on introducing new types of Kashi pairs and
          further evolving from the initial pair that is in production now.
        </p>
        <p>
          Kashi’s biggest inhibitor over the last has been primarily due to lack
          of resources dedicated towards its development, and focus being
          shifted to other products like Trident. Now, we have plans to unlock
          its full potential and exciting things are being cooked up to continue
          to improve on its initial release.
        </p>
        <p>Further improvements include:</p>
        <ul className="list-disc ml-4">
          <li>
            An oracle framework to allow for easy onboarding of any oracle
            provider, and introducing lending and borrowing markets for many
            more tokens.
          </li>
          <li>
            Complete rebuild of the UI that has already been completed, and
            ensures continuity & similar experience to our other products.
          </li>
          <li>
            Completion of key features, such as TWAP support, which unlocks
            lending and borrowing against liquidity pairs and various other
            types of assets within the space.
          </li>
          <li>
            Integration with limit orders to provide margin leveraged orders or
            trading. Better tooling to monitor and inform users on market
            performance, and allow us to A/B test different styles of Kashi
            configurations.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Alongside the introduction of these new features and base improvements
          to Kashi, we have plans and have work being done to improve the user
          experience and introduce easier ways for users to put their assets to
          work within Kashi.
        </p>
        <p>
          A main enhancement to this will be in the form of our Kashi Optimizer,
          that will provide optimized lending rates across multiple isolated
          markets in one place. Users will then be able to deploy a single asset
          in exchange for a koToken, and underneath the optimizer will put the
          tokens to work across multiple markets with the goal of earning user’s
          a higher and more optimized yield.

          Lots of work over the last few months has gone into integrating Miso
          directly into our main Sushi app, and we now have a better system in
          place to scale up the completely permissionless framework. Continued
          work will be done in regards to introducing new forms of recipes, or
          scripts per se that have unified steps that are taken during an
          auction and on release of a new token. The auction creation process
          can then cater to any project’s pre and post-launch plans. Some of
          these enhancements include:
        </p>

        <ul className="list-disc ml-4">
          <li>Gnosis Safe or Minimal Multisig Deployment on launch.</li>
          <li>
            Liquidity Lockups or direct Liquidity Launching to spin up liquidity
            pairs the moment an auction ends.
          </li>
          <li>Vesting schedule put into place at the end of an auction.</li>
          <li>
            Direct incentive deployment, to establish well incentivized farms
            for new projects looking to build their liquidity on Sushi from day
            one.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          In the past Miso was gatekept, or required team involvement to help
          projects launch tokens and provide assistance during the process.
          Today, Miso is now completely permissionless and anyone has the
          ability to spin up new auctions at any time. Permissionless Miso has
          been deployed onto a number of major networks, and is available to use
          for any project regardless of the chain they decide to launch on.
        </p>
        <p>
          Decentralized curation or signaling of Miso Auctions is being
          explored, and we will continue to seek ways we can further improve the
          experience for users to ensure that they are participating in
          legitimate auctions. Read Less

          long as there are no unforeseen complications on the way.

        <p>
          Shōyu 2.0 started development in January of 2022 and was built
          completely from the ground up. We’re approaching a stage now where we
          are starting to show what we’ve been building to the community. It’s
          extremely exciting and we can’t wait to share what we’ve been working
          on.
        </p>

        <p>Features to be excited about:</p>
        <ul className="list-disc ml-4">
          <li>
            Collection and Trait based offer system - This is great if you’ve
            been thinking of purchasing a Moonbird with a particular trait like
            ‘Diamond Eyes’ for a specified price.
          </li>
          <li>
            Add to basket & checkout system including floor sweeping tools - If
            you plan to purchase multiple NFTs in one transaction then this is
            for you and so are the gas savings that come with it.
          </li>
          <li>
            Make a purchase with any combination of tokens in your wallet - All
            listings are in ETH/WETH and we perform the swap under the hood at
            the time of sale.
          </li>
          <li>
            Best NFT indexer and search experience to date - With the help of
            StreamingFast technology we are building the best NFT indexer on the
            market. One of the major pain points with current NFT marketplaces
            is that their search engines are sub-optimal and finding what you
            want is often met with resistance. We’ve put in systems to make this
            a problem of the past.
          </li>
          <li>
            Social features - The social aspect of Shōyu is a completely opt-in
            system, if you do not wish to make a post about your collected or
            created artworks then you don’t have to. We do not have comments
            enabled on the NFT item page on the marketplace. On the other side
            of that discussion we would love for creators and collectors to
            build their communities through Shōyu. We are building a system very
            similar to Twitter where our social features do not interfere with
            the marketplace but instead bolster and promote it. If that’s not
            for you, that’s totally okay. For a quick example of what we can do
            with this; BAYC could make an announcement through Shōyu and only
            allow BAYC owners to comment on the post.
          </li>
          <li>
            Email and in-app notifications for purchases, offers, likes and more
            - When you make a purchase or sale on Shōyu, you can receive a
            notification via email and/or in-app.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          There are more innovative ideas we’re working on at Shōyu and you will
          hear more about them in the coming weeks. We hope to see you in the
          beta trying to break everything you can so we can make the changes
          needed to provide you all with the best product possible.

          The glue to ensuring that Sushi is a self-functioning system is of the
          utmost importance to us. We have plans and work being done to improve
          on the lessons we’ve learned over the past year. We will introduce
          improvements that remove central points of failure.
        </p>

        <p>
          MasterChef for one has been our main incentivization tool, and has
          done wonders for establishing us as a real contender within the
          ecosystem. But with it, because of the ease and speed we needed
          initially to incentivize many different types of liquidity pairs we
          are inhibited to scale it properly as it should be across all chains.
          With this, we will be introducing a new permissionless staking and
          incentive system, so any project can ensure that their liquidity pools
          are properly incentivized to grow their liquidity requirements without
          needing to work directly with the Sushi team. This also improves on
          several of the problems that have been discovered through our various
          chef contracts, such as rewards running out. This introduces clear
          guard rails to ensure users are rewarded as displayed on the
          interface. We believe that Sushi emissions shouldn’t and won’t be
          heavily relied u[on in the future to introduce new tokens to our
          protocol. We’ve observed current farms at 2x to believe that this will
          be the case.
        </p>

        <p>
          Fee collection from our various protocols is another pain point that
          we’ve had to deal with in the past. Further work is being done to cut
          manual operations needed to ensure that xSushi holders are receiving
          the full benefits of activity that happens within our protocols.
          Improvements on the SushiMaker contract have already been put in
          place, and have improved the timeliness of fee delivery but are still
          not fully self-functioning. Thus, we are looking into and
          experimenting with a new style of fee collection in the form of
          SushiMaker Auctions. This is an automated way for fee collection to
          happen without the involvement of the team. Fees can then be
          accumulated and anyone can kick off an auction to sell the accrued
          fees mainly in the form of liquidity positions to the highest bidder
          of the auction. Automation can then easily be slotted in to ensure
          multichain bridging of fees, and provide a better experience for
          xSushi holders.
        </p>
        <p>
          The SushiBar or xSushi is another contract we will continue to think
          and iterate on in regards to improving its existence. For one, we
          think ve-models might not be the best way to go in regards to
          revamping this structure. Though a type of gauge system is very
          intriguing and offers a good way for projects and large holders to
          bribe their way into directing emissions towards their pairs. It
          requires further emissions & major discussions on the hard cap and
          total supply of Sushi. A proposal called Kanpai has been released on
          snapshot, and its primary goal is to move towards a way we can both
          ensure sustainability of the protocol while also ensuring value is
          constantly accruing to the sushi token and its holders. We don’t
          believe a complete scrap of xSushi is the answer to our problems,
          though we do see it as an opportunity to improve on and ensure that
          fees are properly directed towards sustainability and value accrual.
          With that much more discussion and community input/direction will be
          needed in the short future to decide the way forward for xSushi,
          veSushi, or something else.
        </p>
        <p>
          We are still experimenting with products that will unlock more for our
          users. For example, Furo is one of these products that will be
          deployed into production relatively soon and will unlock improved
          token streaming and vesting capabilities. Designed as a framework,
          with composability and additional feature extension in mind.
        </p>

          and are always open to outside collaboration from our community in

          back-running and a rebate system to kickback fees and positive

          Documentation has been an area we’ve highlighted to improve upon.
          Complete revamp of our docs page is underway, and better consolidation
          of information is needed to continue to promote the Open Source nature
          of our development. Ensuring devs will not have to jump through hoops
          while attempting to build on and extend our protocols is tremendously
          important to our ecosystem plans.
        </p>

        <p>
          Users will also be kept in mind as we work on our revamp. Expect
          informative guides & blogs to assist users as they discover and use
          Sushi’s products. We will seek to continue our support for users
          through the Samurai team and we are confident in their abilities to
          continue to improve on this experience.
        </p>

        <p>
          Tooling is another area we’d like to dedicate resources towards,
          including easy to use cli tools for developers to work with. Improving
          the development experience for Open Source developers and keeping
          things simple for advanced users to interact with our protocols is
          key.
        </p>
        <p>
          Improved analytics will continue to be thought through along the road
          ahead. We will work to ensure all users and stakeholders have the
          ability to source the information they need when making financial
          decisions. While also improving the transparency in regards to the
          operations of the protocol, and its journey towards a self-functioning
          and decentralized future.
